"It is a lovely day to be alive.", I thought to myself as the tears ran down my face.
"Despite the constant struggle to be free from all that weighs down against my heart and mind.
I still have hope. God loves me. I know this to be true." "We do not belong to ourselves. This world is just for a time and within this time we must stay vigilant. May obstacles will try to move us from the clarity of mind needed to be our best selves and to see the divinity in all things.""

I continued scrawling my thoughts into the leather-bound journal my teacher had given to me on graduation day.
